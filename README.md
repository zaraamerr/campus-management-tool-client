Users can perform CRUD operations on campuses and students, including viewing, adding, editing, and deleting entries. The website serves as a platform for managing information related to campuses and students efficiently. It aims to provide users with a visually appealing and user-friendly interface where they can easily perform various tasks related to campus administration. This is the frontend of the application.
